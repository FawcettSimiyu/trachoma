                <p>Trachoma is an infectious disease caused by bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea
                    of the eyes, and eventual blindness. is a painful and devastating bacterial eye infection, affecting more than 30 percent of the population across Kenya’s arid and semi-arid areas.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Prevalence in Kenya</h2>
                <p>Prevalence varied according to survey region from less than 1% in four regions where agriculture is the economic base, to 57% and 63% in two arid pastoral regions. Trachoma prevalence varied from 28% in children younger than 3 years of
                    age to 11% in persons older than 60 years of age. It is anticipated the rate of trachoma will be further decreased after a planned 2018 impact assessment.This is encouraging since Africa has the highest rate of trachoma in the world.
                    But the good news is, this disease is preventable and curable, and for patients like Melua, this was a welcome relief.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Trachoma is a disease of the eye caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.</li>
                    <li>It is a public health problem in 44 countries, and is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people.</li>
                    <li>Based on March 2019 data, 142 million people live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma blindness.</li>
                    <li>Infection spreads through personal contact (via hands, clothes or bedding) and by flies that have been in contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. With repeated episodes of infection over many years, the
                        eyelashes may be drawn in so that they rub on the surface of the eye, with pain and discomfort and permanent damage to the cornea.</li>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why</h2>
            <p>The practices that contributed to transmission of infection included: failure to wash faces and bathe regularly, sharing of water basins and towels for face washing, traditional methods of trachoma treatment and dirty household environment.
                Due to socio-cultural perceptions, toilets were unacceptable and use of bushes for human waste disposal was common. Poor perceptions on disease susceptibility, flies on children’s faces, latrine ownership and usage and separation of human
                and animal dwellings also played a role in the transmission of trachoma. </p>
